# Prework Study Guide Code webpage

## A Study Guide for Pre-work Course.

This is a study guide built by Gordon to help boot camp stdents including me learn and understand how to code. I was motivated to build this progect to get a better understanding about the basics of coding. This website solved the problem of understanding what the fudementals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript are and how they can be applied in building a website. I learned the basics of each of these terms and applications and what language to use within them.
